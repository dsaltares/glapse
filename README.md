### What is gLapse?

gLapse stands for Gnome Time lapse, is a simple GTK tool that allows you to take lots of screenshots
at fixed intervals. Then you can glue them together to produce a time lapse video.

It was conceived to be used at [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/) 48h game development competition
by Linux people but you can also try it! It doesn't have a huge variety of options but it's pretty easy to use.
